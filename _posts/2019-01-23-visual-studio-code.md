Testing how to add a blog post using Visual Studio Code

Create a new post in the bash terminal by pressing ctrl-` (which deligtfully reminds me of my days playing Quake II) or selecting "View - Toggle Integrated Terminal" from the menu.

```
rake post title="Visual Studio Code"
```

This creates a new file in the _posts folder with the current data and title as its filename. For example: ```2019-01-23-visual-studio=code.md```
